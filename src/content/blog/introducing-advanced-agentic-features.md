# Introducing Advanced Agentic AI Features  

Today, we're thrilled to unveil a major upgrade to our AI agents' capabilities, introducing advanced features that make them more autonomous and intelligent than ever before. While these exciting updates are ready, access will be rolled out gradually to ensure the best possible experience for our users.

Our upgraded agentic features include:  

#### Enhanced Autonomous Decision Making  
Our agents can now analyze situations and make informed decisions independently, leveraging advanced reasoning capabilities to choose the best course of action.  

#### Contextual Understanding  
Agents can now understand complex scenarios and user intent with advanced reasoning, enabling more natural and effective interactions.  

#### Proactive Action Taking  
Agents are now capable of anticipating needs and taking initiative when appropriate, offering a more proactive and seamless user experience.  

#### Adaptive Learning  
With every interaction, our agents learn and adapt, continuously improving their performance and expanding their capabilities.  

## Impact and Applications  

These updates mark a significant leap forward in our mission to create truly autonomous AI agents that can think and act independently. Whether you're building:  

- Customer service solutions  
- Automation tools  
- Complex AI applications  

Our agents are now equipped to handle more sophisticated tasks with minimal human intervention.  

## Gradual Rollout  

We are currently rolling out these features to select users in stages to ensure the highest quality and reliability. Weâ€™re committed to gathering feedback and refining the experience before making these features broadly available.
