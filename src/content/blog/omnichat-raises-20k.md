# OmniChat Raises $20k to Advance Autonomous AI Agents  

We are thrilled to announce that OmniChat has successfully raised $20k in pre-seed funding to revolutionize the field of autonomous AI agents. This milestone marks a significant step forward in our mission to create AI that can truly think, decide, and act independently.  

In addition to this funding, we are excited to share that OmniChat has received **equity-free support** from **Google for Startups Cloud Program** and **Microsoft Founders Hub**. These programs provide us with essential resources, including cloud credits and technical support, empowering us to scale our AI development efforts without diluting equity.  

## Our Vision  

At OmniChat, we believe in a future where AI agents can operate autonomously, understanding context and making informed decisions just like humans do. Our agentic AI technology goes beyond simple chat interfacesâ€”it's about creating intelligent agents that can reason, learn, and take action on their own.  

## Key Highlights  

- $20k pre-seed round to advance autonomous AI technology  
- Equity-free support from Google for Startups Cloud Program and Microsoft Founders Hub  
- Building next-generation agentic AI capabilities  
- Expanding our team of AI researchers and engineers  
- Developing more sophisticated reasoning and decision-making models  

## What's Next  

With this funding and support, we're focusing on:  

1. Enhancing our agents' autonomous decision-making abilities  
2. Developing more sophisticated reasoning capabilities  
3. Expanding our agents' ability to learn from interactions  
4. Growing our team of AI researchers and engineers  

We're incredibly grateful for the trust our investors have placed in our vision of truly autonomous AI agents, as well as the invaluable support from Google for Startups and Microsoft Founders Hub. These partnerships will enable us to push boundaries and accelerate innovation in the AI space.
